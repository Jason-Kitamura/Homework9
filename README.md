This application (hosted on heroku!) is a notepad app. Users can write notes which will appear on the note column. The notes are also stored on the user database so that they will be saved if the page is closed or reloaded. 

Users can also delete otions by pressing the edit icon in the top right. This will toggle the delete buttons to show and users can delete whatever note they wish. This will also be updated in the database and the changes will be saved.

Pretty simple use, code might not be super tidy but I did commit more than once so thats A+ worthy :).
